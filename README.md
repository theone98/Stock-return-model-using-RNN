# Stock-return-model-using-RNN and LSTM

In this model total stock return value is predicted using RNN and LSTM using several different  parameters ,several different times but it can can be seen in the final ploted graph of accuracy and loss that multiple step prediction of return gives a siginificant amount........so even RNN and LSTM can't accurately predict stock return accurately.
